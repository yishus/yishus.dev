                This blog is kept intentionally bare, you can see the
                <a href="https://github.com/yishus/yishus.dev">source code here</a>.
                Maybe because front-end work is already what I spend most of my working
                hours on, I want a space where only the words matter (and also
                semantics, semantics matter).

              Initially I was searching for a static site generator as a way to convert content written in say Markdown
              into HTML. But since this is my personal hobby site and I'm fully comfortable with writing in HTML, so here
              it is - a site where I write HTML by hand.

            <h3>Now</h3>
            <p>
              I'm still on my journey to better understand programming languages. I spent some time on this at
              <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> earlier this year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently I'm working through Bob Nystrom's <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              My major was in Electrical Engineering, not exactly Computer Science, so I'm taking this year (while also working)
              to work on a CS degree. Currently working through <a href="https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/">functionalCS<a/>.
              I'll probably want to document this seperately as a project.
            </p>
            <p>And sadly I can't remember much about Electrical Engineering now.</p>
            <p>
                Also working towards being comfortable at climbing at V3, I do feel stronger than a year ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              Was blown away from a cup of coffee from <a href="https://www.nyloncoffee.sg/">Nylon Coffee Roasters</a>, the
              first time I could actually taste the tasting notes. I have gotten beans from them before but have never been
              able to pull a shot this good.
            </p>
            <p>
              So a bit of coffee studying also.
