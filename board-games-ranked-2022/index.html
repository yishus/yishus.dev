          Funny thing board gamers like to do, at the end of each year they rank
          every games they've ever played and check to see if how the games
          stand have changed across the years. Board games tend to remain
          favourites for years, so it didn't really make sense for people to do
          their favourite game released that year (which also differs based on
          language, availability).

          joining in the fun this year, and thanks to the good folks at
          <a href="https://www.pubmeeple.com/ranking-engine" target="_blank"
            >Pub Meeple</a
          >
          for the ranking engine, my list for 2022:
        </p>

        <ol reversed>
          <li>
            <h2>Clans of Caledonia</h2>
            <p>
              Where else do you get to rep a Scottish clan, rear sheeps and make
              whisky in the highlands. It often gets referred to as "My first
              Terra Mystica" because of the similar hexagonal tiles ownership
              mechanism. However, the market is what shines in this game - you
              will never have enough time to produce all the goods you need, and
              other players are keen to sell their leftovers with the price of
              goods adjusted by demand. Plan well and you can enjoy combolicious
              turns when you fulfill on orders.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've only played this

                >news of reprint happening in 2023</a
              >), and every game had a beautiful mix of brain burning plan ahead
              with sarcity driven players' interactions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Scythe</h2>
            <p>
              Action selection, area control hybrid game. But at its core, it's
              an engine building game, the game allows you to invest in upgrades
              to do more on each action taken, but costing precious resources
              when improvements might only yield after several turns. Take
              control over hexagonal tiles indicating the resource that you
              could produce (including workers "Let's make some humans"), deploy
              mechs that give you powers and enlist recruits so you gain stuff
              when other people do stuff?
            </p>
            <p>
              I still remember hating my first game. Holed up in my corner, I
              was focused on optimising my engine, and the end came before
              anything could happen. But it grew on me, I got the game on steam
              to play with AIs. Still painfully losing all my games.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Food Chain Magnate</h2>
            <p>
              Ohh a difficult one. This game has no training wheels and could
              let you spend 2 hours with nothing to show for.
            </p>
            <p>
              Food chain magnate, you play as the CEO of a fictius fast food
              restaurant owner, operating in a world where food is in perfect
              competition. Decide who and when you will hire, and train your
              people to scale the corporate ladder. Put out advertisement to
              remind the homeowners in your neighbourhood that they got to eat,
              and hire zeplin pilots(?) to deliver soft drinks.
            </p>
            <p>
              The achievements mechanism is unlike any other. Because of the
              first-players-get-all nature of the achievements, you have to
              react to what you think the other players are doing, and
              strategise to outmaneuver on these goals. Money is VP is money.
              Literally you spend victory points to invest for more, and you
              could end with none. It emulates market behaviour cleanly that it
              could have been made as a business school teaching tool.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar</h2>
            <p>
              Time waits for no man, the literal centrepiece in Tzolk'in is an
              ever turning wheel of time. Place your workers in one of six
              resource gears, and wait for time to do its thang. When you're
              ready to pull your worker from the gear, gain the resource
              indicated at the worker's location. Let your worker spend more
              time (and turns) on the resource gear and you get better rewards.
              But workers are limited and they cost a ton of corn to feed.
              Invest in technology to make your actions cheaper, and climb up
              the temple ladders for victory points.
            </p>
            <p>
              Innovative worker placement elegantly implemented as spinning
              gears. I especially love the mechanism of investing for future
              rewards while balancing paying (feeding) your workers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Terra Mystica</h2>
            <p>
              Land is tight in Terra Mystica, you play as a magical race to
              conquer land and build structures to grow your cities. Structures
              are your sources for resources and VPs, the joy of upgrading your
              resources overflow to neighbours who can then lose VPs to charge
              power. Power? You move purple discs around your 3 purple bowls in
              order to gain more resources. Also there are temple tracks to gain
              more resources and VPs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Resource is tiiiiight and the wide decision space puts you right
              into the driver's seat. Money or spades? Upgrade now or later?
              Should you burn that power? A well executed plan feels buttery
              smooth and so satisfying when the reward combos come in. Fans go
              to
              <a href="https://terra.snellman.net/" target="_blank"

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Tigris & Euphrates</h2>
            <p>
              Tactical abstract area majority game. You lay tiles of 4 colours
              onto a board, vying for control over regions. Blue are river tiles
              that go onto rivers, red are temple tiles that double as combat
              tiles, black for wild and green required to obtain treasures. You
              lay tiles in strategic positions to prepare for combat, while each
              player keeps a hidden hand of tiles which they can use to bolster
              their military strength.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's revenge the game, the joy comes from upstaging a player in a
              strong position when they don't expect it. And building your
              empire so well guarded it's impenetrable. Like similar tactical
              abstract games, you create situations of tradeoffs that your
              opponents have to make when advancing their objectives. Battling
              my green empire might weaken your hold on the black one. It's
              delicious, crunchy and a good afternoon of battle of wits.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Great Western Trail (2nd Edition)</h2>
            <p>
              Ah the cow game. Deck building, area space ownership game. You are
              a cowboy sending your cows to Kansas, passing through both neutral
              and stops owned by other players. You get to improve your hand of
              cows through using the cards at the stops (are you loaning your
              cows?) and get cash to buy more buildings, cows or employees.
            </p>
            <p>
              I only started playing it this year, having played Maracaibo (from
              the same designer) before this. Hated my first play, it took so
              long and each turn felt inconseqeuntial. But I've come to realise
              that's the charm of this game. The decision space for each turn is
              small, especially good to AP-prone players, but understanding how
              each small action can contribute to the larger direction of your
              game. Make too many bad decisions and you can't catch up anymore.
              Play with experienced players and the turns fly by quickly when
              players skip the low value stops in the path.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Root</h2>
            <p>
              Root is a conflict simulator with cute animals. I wanted to
              venture out of the usual economic Euros and this came up so often.
              I was mesmerised by the faction design and the clever use of the
              simple deck of common cards that all factions play with. Mind
              blown each time I learned how to play a new faction, and you could
              easily imagine how the faction will affect the incentives of the
              game. However, difficult to bring to the table, learning curve for
              new players to onboard to the new factions is high.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Brass: Birmingham</h2>
            <p>
              Industrial revolution with a lot of trains. This is a classic
              Martin Wallace game. Innovative use of cards, iron and copper and
              a lot of trains. Brass gets to hit a sweet spot in crunchy Euros
              where the decision space is wide, but with enough constraints so
              each decision feel snappy. Cards determine what kind or where you
              can build, while connected cities determine how you can build
              them. Buttery smooth when played well. Satisfying.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Gaia Project</h2>
            <p>
              Terra Mystica in Space. The same delicious decision space from
              Terra Mystica, but it improved the VP heavy temple tracks to
              upgradeable technology tracks. Like TM, it's a game in which the
              answer to "what is the optimal move?" is "it depends". Depending
              on the situation on the board, the reward of each round and the
              randomly selected overall objectives of the game, you got to
              adjust your strategy. And I can't believe they even improved on
              the factions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some qualms, the plastic pieces are uglier than the wooden ones in
              Terra Mystica. And the faction design (as opposed to mechanism)
              pales compared to TM - the alien races feel boring and similar.
              Earlier on I shared that the factions improved, but the good
              factions still remain a small handful.
            </p>
            <p>
              I understand why this is my number 1 game. The sense of agency you
              get over your fate in the game, the excitement of capturing a
              space before your opponent, the beautifully designed rounds that
              makes you feel like you've achieved all you can, but not more.

        <h2>Looking forward to</h2>
        <p>
          2022 has been a great year for releases, especially this month, when
          all the conventions are over. I'm looking forward to sinking my teeth
          into the simplified versions of several games in my top 50 - Horizons
          of Spirit Island, Terra Nova and Wingspan Asia. The new game in the
          Undaunted series with Undaunted Staligard. And the new clank with
          Clank! Catacombs. Also to go through my unplayed games - Brian Boru,
          Auztralia and Wonderland's War.
        </p>
        <p>
          Managed to log 187 plays this year and I miss a lot of the ones I play
          digitally. Looking forward to what 2023 brings!
