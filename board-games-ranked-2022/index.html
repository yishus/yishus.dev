      <h1>Top 10 Board Games of All-Time | 2022 Edition</h1>
      <small>22 Dec 2022</small>
      <p>Funny thing board gamers like to do, at the end of each year they rank every games they've ever played and check to see if how the games stand have changed across the years. Board games tend to remain favourites for years, so it didn't really make sense for people to do their favourite game released that year (which also differs based on language, availability). I'm joining in the fun this year, and thanks to the good folks at <a href="https://www.pubmeeple.com/ranking-engine" target="_blank">Pub Meeple</a> for the ranking engine, my list for 2022:</p>
      <h2>10. Clans of Caledonia</h2>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_WktgVAHbTQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Where else do you get to rep a Scottish clan, rear sheeps and make whisky in the highlands. It often gets referred to as "My first Terra Mystica" because of the similar hexagonal tiles ownership mechanism. However, the market is what shines in this game - you will never have enough time to produce all the goods you need, and other players are keen to sell their leftovers with the price of goods adjusted by demand. Plan well and you can enjoy combolicious turns when you fulfill on orders.</p>
      <p>I've only played this <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=clansofcaledonia" target="_blank">online</a> (<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2979235/clans-caledonia-coming-back-reprint-2023" target="_blank">news of reprint happening in 2023</a>), and every game had a beautiful mix of brain burning plan ahead with sarcity driving players' interactions.</p>
      <h2>9. Scythe</h2>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ypavv5xpfVk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Action selection, area control hybrid game. But at its core, it's an engine building game, the game allows you to invest in upgrades to do more on each action taken, but costing precious resources when improvements might only yield after several turns. Take control over hexagonal tiles indicating the resource that you could produce (including workers "Let's make some humans"), deploy mechs that give you powers and enlist recruits so you gain stuff when other people do stuff?</p>
      <p>I still remember hating my first game. Holed up in my corner, I was focused on optimising my engine, and the end came before anything could happen. But it grew on me, I got the game on steam to play with AIs. Still painfully losing all my games.</p>
      <h2>8. Food Chain Magnate</h2>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CQ4z900WFj4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Ohh a difficult one. This game has no training wheels and could let you spend 2 hours with nothing to show for.</p>
      <p>Food chain magnate, you play as the CEO of a fictious fast food restaurant owner, operating in a world where food is in perfect competition. Decide who and when you will hire, and train your people to scale the corporate ladder. Put out advertisement to remind the homeowners in your neighbourhood that they got to eat, and hire zeplin pilots(?) to deliver soft drinks.</p>
      <p>The achievements mechanism is unlike any other. Because of the first-players-get-all nature of the achievements, you have to react to what you think the other players are doing, and strategise to outmaneuver on these goals. Money is VP is money. Literally you spend victory points to invest for more, and you could end with none. It emulates market behaviour cleanly that it could have been made as a business school teaching tool.</p>
      <h2>7. Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar</h2>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L3z4JW6Ogh8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Time waits for no man, the literal centrepiece in Tzolk'in  is an ever turning wheel of time. Place your workers in one of six resource gears, and wait for time to do its thang. When you're ready to pull your worker from the gear, gain the resource indicated at the worker's location. Let your worker spend more time (and turns) on the resource gear and you get better rewards. But workers are limited and they cost a ton of corn to feed. Invest in technology to make your actions cheaper, and climb up the temple ladders for victory points.</p>
      <p>Innovative worker placement elegantly implemented as spinning gears. I especially love the mechanism of investing for future rewards while balancing paying (feeding) your workers.</p>
      <h2>6. Terra Mystica</h2>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NhykWljEhHs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Land is tight in Terra Mystica, you play as a magical race to conquer land and build structures to grow your cities. Structures are your sources for resources and VPs, the joy of upgrading your resources overflow to neighbours who can then lose VPs to charge power. Power? You move purple discs around your 3 purple bowls in order to gain more resources. Also there are temple tracks to gain more resources and VPs.</p>
      <p>Resource is tiiiiight and the wide decision space puts you right into the driver's seat. Money or spades? Upgrade now or later? Should you burn that power? A well executed plan feels buttery smooth and so satisfying when the reward combos come in. Fans go to <a href="https://terra.snellman.net/" target="_blank">Snellman's site</a> for games and stats. Do also check out the well implemented <a href="https://lodev.org/tmai/" target="_blank">AI</a>.</p>
      <h2>5. Tigris & Euphrates</h2>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Jl_ensO_UY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Tactical abstract area majority game. You lay tiles of 4 colours onto a board, vying for control over regions. Blue are river tiles that go onto rivers, red are temple tiles that double as combat tiles, black for wild and green required to obtain treasures. You lay tiles in strategic positions to prepare for combat, while each player keeps a hidden hand of tiles which they can use to bolster their military strength.</p>
      <p>It's revenge the game, the joy comes from upstaging a player in a strong position when they don't expect it. And building your empire so well guarded it's impenetrable. Like similar tactical abstract games, you create situations of tradeoffs that your opponents have to make when advancing their objectives. Battling my green empire might weaken your hold on the black one. It's delicious, crunchy and a good afternoon of battle of wits.</p>
      <h2>4. Great Western Trail (2nd Edition)</h2>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KeJOpVQ874" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Ah the cow game.</p>
      <h2>3. Root</h2>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_DeiLju40I0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Root is a conflict simulator with cute animals.</p>
      <h2>2. Brass: Birmingham</h2>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e3efv2HkjDI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Industrial revolution with trains.</p>
      <h2>1. Gaia Project</h2>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHUANoSeWEo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
