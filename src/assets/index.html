      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Yishu (like a GitHub <i>issue</i>) and I'm a software
        engineer. In my day job I manipulate data and design APIs while my
        interest lies in tool design which has led me to explore areas such as
        programming languages and code bundling. I'm drawn to problems that
        reward taste and software that feels obvious in hindsight and slightly
        embarrassing to explain in detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously I worked on ads and marketplaces in Shopify, built web
        fundamentals at Carousell, and helped early start-up founders scale at
        Shiip.
      </p>
      <p>
        I received my BEng in Electrical Engineering from National University of
        Singapore, concentrating on human-computer interaction.
      </p>
      <p>I run a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/figment.coffee">weekend cafe</a> at home.<!-- and occasional meetup Weird Computing</p> -->

      <h4>Interests</h4>
      <p>I'm always excited to talk about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tools. Especially personal knowledge management, spaced repetition and
          code editors. I rotate between Neovim and Emacs and am equally
          enthusiastic for both. My current terminal emulator is Ghostty, and I
          write on Org mode and RemNote. I am currently trying out Jujutsu.
        </li>
        <li>Programming language and type system</li>
        <li>
          Puzzles. I'm a regular attendant at
          <a href="https://puzzledpint.org/">Puzzled Pint</a> and participated
          in CMU Puzzle Hunt 2025. I also enjoy Connections, Advent of Code and
          puzzle video games such as Blue Prince and Chants of Sennaar.
        </li>
        <li>Malleable software</li>
        <li>
          Board games. I own 92 and have
          <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/profile/yishus">recorded</a> plays
          of 382 games. My favorite mechanism is dice selection.
        </li>
        <li>Climbing</li>
        <li>Food and coffee</li>
      </ul>
