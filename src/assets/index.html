      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Yishu (like a GitHub <i>issue</i>) and I'm a software
        engineer. In my day job I manipulate data and design APIs. My interest
        lies in tool design which has led me to explore areas such as
        programming language design and code bundling. I'm drawn to problems
        that reward taste and software that feels obvious in hindsight and
        slightly embarrassing to explain in detail.

      <h4>Interests</h4>
      <p>I'm always excited to talk about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tools. Especially personal knowledge management, spaced repetition and
          code editors. I rotate between Neovim and Emacs and am equally
          enthusiatic for both. My current terminal emulator is Ghostty, and I
          write on org mode and RemNote. I am currently trying out jujutsu.
        </li>
        <li>Programming language design</li>
        <li>
          Puzzles. I'm a regular attendant at
          <a href="https://puzzledpint.org/">Puzzled Pint</a> and participated
          in CMU Puzzle Hunt 2025.
        </li>
        <li>Malleable software</li>
        <li>
          Board games. I own 92 and have
          <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/profile/yishus">recorded</a> plays
          of 382 games. My favorite mechanisms are dice selection and multi-use
          cards.
        </li>
        <li>Climbing, especially indoor bouldering</li>
        <li>Food and coffee</li>
      </ul>
