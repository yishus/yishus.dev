### Bundler

I've resisted using a static site generator for a long time, this website has always been a single origin farm to table site with handwritten HTML. But in order to support this notes page, I figured it makes more sense to use a bundler than to duplicate the content. So now this is still a single origin farm to table site but with a custom bundler cobbled together on bun. As always you can see the source on [github](https://github.com/yishus/yishus.dev).
