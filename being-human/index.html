        <h1>Being Human</h1>
        <small>4 May 2021</small>
        <p>
            I used to grow up spending a lot of time in front of the tv watching
            television dramas, and I used to justify that as my window to the human
            condition - I understood how to be human by watching other human make
            believe.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then slowly I watched less and less, not sure if it's because we no
            longer make quality tv or that I just got tired of it. Recently I
            re-watched several early 2000s Japanese dramas and got reminded why I
            liked them so much. I don't read fiction much, and tv was my source of
            fiction. It just felt good seeing people overcome difficulties, learned
            to collaborate, and just love life.

            It hit me to keep a list of content that reminds me of being human,
            And here it is
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network">The Social Network</a>. Without unpacking what this film means for us, look at them, human struggling to be human.</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a>. Also,</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef%27s_Table">Chef's Table</a>. Come on, this is a treasure trove.</li>
            <li>Alex Honnold. He is a joy to watch, especially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncDFDz9k35o">here</a>.</li>
